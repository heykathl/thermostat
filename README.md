# Thermostat

## Objectives

 * Test-drive a simple JS application.

## Domain model

You'll build, test-driving your code, a simple program to manage a thermostat. Here is the specification for the initial MVP of the program:

* The Thermostat starts with an initial temperature of 20 degrees
* You can increase the temperature with an `up` method
* You can decrease the temperature with a `down` method
* The *minimum possible temperature* is 10 degrees
* The *Power saving mode* is *on by default* but it can also be turned off
* *If power saving mode is on*, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
* *If power saving mode is off*, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
* You can reset the temperature to 20 with a `reset` method
* You can ask about the thermostat's *current energy usage*: < 18 is low-usage, <= 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.

You'll know if your class `Thermostat` is correctly implemented if you can run the following code. **Your tests should also reflect the same requirements.**
